In this project I have done:
1. CSS:
  - Module classes (Head.jsx, Head.module.css)
  - Preprocessor SCSS (App.scss)
  - Styled components in Footer (<Footer>*content*</Footer>)
2. Working with API, using methods:
  - GET - to get the info about recipe:
    i. we are getting info on home page
    ii. we are getting info on single recipe
  - POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipes) - to rate your dish by clicking on star and then submiting it (look to the console)
  - POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipe-details) - to add your own new recipe (look to the console)
3. Last two methods are also adding to your localStorage (Rating stars, Adding recipe)
4. Fontawesome icons - 3 of them
5. Routing - 3 pages (Home, AddRecipe page and Signel recipe page)
6. POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipe-details) - adding form, where you can add unlimited quantity of ingredients
