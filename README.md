# In this project I have done:

### 1. CSS

- Module classes (Head.jsx, Head.module.css)
- Preprocessor SCSS (App.scss)
- Styled components in Footer (<Footer>*content*</Footer>)

### 2. Working with API, using methods:

- GET - to get the info about recipe:
  1. we are getting info on home page
  2. we are getting info on single recipe
- POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipes) - to rate your dish by clicking on star and then submiting it (look to the console)
- POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipe-details) - to add your own new recipe (look to the console)

### 3. Last two methods are also adding to your localStorage (Rating stars, Adding recipe)

### 4. Fontawesome icons - 3 of them

### 5. Routing - 3 pages (Home, AddRecipe page and Signel recipe page)

### 6. POST (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AckeeCZ/web-task-cookbook-fake-api/recipe-details):
- Adding form, where you can add unlimited quantity of ingredients
